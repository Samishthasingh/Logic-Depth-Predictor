# Logic-Depth-Predictor
This project addresses the critical challenge of timing analysis delays in complex IP/SoC design. By developing an AI algorithm to predict combinational logic depth of signals from RTL code, we aim to significantly reduce the time spent waiting for post-synthesis timing reports.
